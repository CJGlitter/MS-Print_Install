# MS-Print_Install
An executable program to setup the PayPal Print Server on Treeps' computers.

Made as a project by Cory Davis [CJ Glitter] to practice making executables.

Not endorsed by BTHD



Print-Amer-Setup:
This is the program to install it. It's stylized.  I will be making a simplified version
soon with no "bells & whistles" to share with BTHD

As of 2/21/2020, MS_Printer_Setup is identical to Print-Amer-Setup, but it is named more
clearly and intended for distribution to only BT-MS

Current release is a .zip folder with accompanying instructions. The actual file is ran from the terminal per the instructions.


Future releases will be self-contained and require less interraction with the terminal.
